  #### Install `pyenv` and `pyenv-virtualenv`

  Make sure you have Homebrew installed, then run the following commands to install `pyenv` and `pyenv-virtualenv`:

  ```bash
  brew install pyenv
  brew install pyenv-virtualenv
  ```

  #### Install Python

  Use `pyenv` to install the desired version of Python. In this project, we are using Python 3.12.0:

  ```bash
  pyenv install 3.12.0
  ```

  #### Create a Virtual Environment

  Create a virtual environment named `namewiz` using `pyenv-virtualenv`:

  ```bash
  pyenv virtualenv 3.12.0 namewiz
  ```

  #### Connect the Virtual Environment to the Project Directory

  Set the local Python version to the virtual environment you just created:

  ```bash
  pyenv local namewiz
  ```
  #### Install the required dependencies

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

  #### Install and configure pre-commit hooks

  ```bash
  pip install pre-commit
  pre-commit install
  ```

  #### Run pre-commit hooks manually (optional)

  ```bash
  pre-commit run --all-files
  ```

  #### Create a `.env` File

  To securely store environment variables, create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. Add the following content to the `.env` file:

  ```plaintext
  GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
  ```

  #### Obtain a GitHub Token

  To obtain a GitHub token, follow these steps:

  1. Go to [GitHub Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
  2. Click on **Generate new token**.
  3. Select the scopes or permissions you need for your token.
  4. Click **Generate token**.
  5. Copy the generated token and paste it into your `.env` file as shown above.

  Make sure to keep your token secure and do not share it publicly.
